# README

The purpose of this site is because I've always enjoyed the pc parts picker site but I wanted to be able to show what my final build could or would like in a drag and drop into place fashion. I am somewhat new to web development (only know how to use html, css, javascript, some php, and some rails) so I hope creating this site will teach me skills and propel me faster to getting employed in the field! 

As a side note. If you want to help, especially those versed in the interactivity (javascript) portion, I would love some tips or help after I build the initial framework.

I will update my progression in milestones.

First Milestone: Initial framework design
